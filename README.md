# Neighborhood Map
This is the 5th project in the Udacity Full-stack Nanodegree. We were tasked with creating a single page application featuring a neighborhood/area that you would like to visit and then adding functionality to highlight locations and pull in third party data.

## APIs Used
* Google Maps
* Foursquare

## Other Tools
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* knockout

## Setup
Download or clone the repository and open the index.html file. 

### NOTE 
There are other locations in the models.js file that can be uncommented. However, due to a low limit on free Foursquare API calls, I have decided to limit the project to 5 locations.

### To Do
When backspacing out of the search bar, locations don't set to visible
